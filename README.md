# Usage
The Streamlit application provides various options for analyzing and visualizing the PMC complaints data. Here are the available options:

# Singular: 
Select a specific ward and view the probabilities of negative complaints for different categories (cleanliness, footpath, water, road). Additionally, visualize the negative and positive counts for each category in a pie chart.

# Comparison_top3: 
Compare the top 3 wards with the lowest negative complaint probabilities for each category (cleanliness, footpath, water, road). Visualize the probabilities using bar charts.

# Comparison_All_Cleanliness:
Compare the negativity percentages of all wards for the cleanliness category using a pie chart.

# Comparison_All_Footpath: 
Compare the negativity percentages of all wards for the footpath category using a pie chart.

# Comparison_All_Water: 
Compare the negativity percentages of all wards for the water category using a pie chart.

Comparison_All_Road: 
Compare the negativity percentages of all wards for the road category using a pie chart.
